Given a string and a pattern, find out if the string contains any permutation of the pattern.

Permutation is defined as the re-arranging of the characters of the string. For example, “abc” has the following six permutations:

    abc
    acb
    bac
    bca
    cab
    cba
    
If a string has ‘n’ distinct characters it will have n! permutations.
