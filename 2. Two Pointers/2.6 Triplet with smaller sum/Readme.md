Given an array arr of unsorted numbers and a target sum, 
count all triplets in it such that 

arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] < target 

where i, j, and k are three different indices. 

Write a function to return the count of such triplets.

Input: [-1, 0, 2, 3], target=3 

Output: 2

Explanation: There are two triplets whose sum is less than the target: [-1, 0, 3], [-1, 0, 2]
