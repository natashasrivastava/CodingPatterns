Given a list of non-overlapping intervals sorted by their start time, insert a given interval at the correct position and merge all necessary intervals to produce a list that has only mutually exclusive intervals.

Input: Intervals=[[1,3], [5,7], [8,12]], New Interval=[4,6]

Output: [[1,3], [4,7], [8,12]]

Explanation: After insertion, since [4,6] overlaps with [5,7], we merged them into one [4,7].
